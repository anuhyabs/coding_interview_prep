# Coding Interview Preperation
This repository tracks my attempt to work on Leetcode problems for Data Science Coding Interviews daily. 

I have started with the highly recommended Blind 75 Problems.
They have been divided into Easy, Medium and Hard folders.

I plan to:
- create a folder for common coding solutions and algorithms for easy lookup in the future
- complete Blind 75 problems
- complete the Must Do 150 
- create folders specific to data structures like graphs and trees - link to problems that have been completed above in the following topic as well as new questions that I encounter during interviews
- create a folder for questions asked during my interviews
- add links to interesting blogs/solutions/videos that I discover while coding to keep in handy for reference in future.

Overall, this repository is aimed to becoming my one-stop place for any future coding preperations/references.
